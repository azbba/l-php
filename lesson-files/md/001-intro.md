`PHP` is a scripting language that is especially suited for web development.  

## PHP Tags:

When PHP parses a file, it look for opening and closing tag, which tell PHP to start and stop interpreting the code between them.  

```php
    <?php
        // PHP code to execute
    ?>
```

```php
    <?= "text to print" ?>
```

PHP supports 'C', 'C++' and Unix shell-style (Perl style) comments. For example:  

```php
/*
    This is 
    a multi-line 
    comments
*/

// This is a single line comment

# This is Unix shell-style comment
```
